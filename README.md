# Orbital_Mechanics_to_ISS
## randezvous_solver.m 
-takes a random point on lower circilar orbit, and finds the point on the elliptic ISS orbit after implementing a transfer orbit. Also takes a random point on ISS orbit and finds the ISS's future point after the time that is equal to the transfer orbit duration. Output: randomized locations.png
## randezvous_solver_loop.m
-does the same thing and finds the possible randezvous points on ISS orbit. Output: possible randezvous points.png
## dθ = 1 deg
